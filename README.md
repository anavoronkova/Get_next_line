# Get_next_line

A function for getting the next line of a file.
The size of the buffer can be set using the -D flag.

## Algorithm

A full line is a string that ends in \n or EOF.
As long as there is no full line in the buffer, keep reading from the file and appending the read bytes to the buffer. As soon as there is a full line, remove it from the beginning of the buffer, and return the line.
The buffer has to be a static variable, so that it persists in between calls to get_next_line.
The main challenge in this project is to resolve all memory leaks.

## Bonus

Handle multiple file descriptors.
